## Section 1: Linux History 

Linux traces its origins to Unix, created in 1969 at AT&T's Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others. Ritchie later rewrote Unix in C, making it more adaptable and widely used in universities and corporations. After Unix became proprietary in 1984, Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project in 1983 to create a free Unix-like system, while Andrew Tanenbaum developed MINIX, a simplified Unix version for educational use. In 1991, Linus Torvalds, frustrated with MINIX's limitations, developed the Linux kernel, which, when combined with GNU components, formed the free and open-source Linux operating system under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

## Section 2: Linux Distributions 
Linux distributions are customized versions of Linux that are made specific according with needs of users so that they can have a good experience. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, thereâ€™s a distro suited for you.

### Popular Linux Distributions:

- **Ubuntu**: 
- **Debian**:
- **Fedora**: 
### Describe the differences between various distributions.
 - Fedora :- With it's great linux features makes it most popular.
 - Ubuntu :-Its the most basic OS and has long term support
 - Oracle Linux:- This one has 24/7 support and is a free OS.










### Describe the differences between various distributions.
Linux Mint is built on Ubuntu/Debian and designed for simplicity, making it perfect for users switching from Windows. It features the Cinnamon desktop, comes with pre-installed software and media codecs, and offers a more familiar interface for Windows users.   

Zorin OS is also based on Ubuntu and focuses on providing an easy transition for users migrating from Windows or macOS. It offers a polished, customizable interface that mimics those systems, making it highly user-friendly, though it has a smaller community and some paid features.
